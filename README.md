# MGS Lang

The MGS Programming Language Compiler

Please note this is still very much a work in progress. 

Currently this compiler is implemented in Rust, with plans to move towards implementing in MGS itself eventually.

## Why MGS?

MGS is a statically typed, low level programming language designed for systems development focussed on code maintainance and large scale project management.

## Features

As we implement some of our main features, they will be added here.
